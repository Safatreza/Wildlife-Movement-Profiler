# Wildlife Movement Profiler — Simple Usage

## 1. Start the Backend Dashboard

From anywhere in your project, run:
```sh
python Wildlife-Movement-Profiler-main/Wildlife-Movement-Profiler-main/dashboard/app.py
```

## 2. Open the Dashboard in Your Browser

Go to:
- http://localhost:8050/

That’s it! The dashboard will be available and fully functional.

## Troubleshooting
- If you see an error about `dashboard/static` not existing, make sure the directory exists:
  ```sh
  mkdir Wildlife-Movement-Profiler-main/Wildlife-Movement-Profiler-main/dashboard/static
  ```
- If port 8050 is in use, stop any other process using it or change the port in the command above.
